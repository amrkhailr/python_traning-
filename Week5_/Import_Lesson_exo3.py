# Import function in Python: Ok, as we know we cant ping any IP addresses from the python terminal, in order to use ping in Python, we have to install a built in fucntion 
# which is called pythonping in the Python terminal and then we can ping. Thats what funciotn and fundtion does, we have 10000 and more of funtions like Pythonping which 
# which can be imported and installed as a function and make life easire. For example Ansible is all impported or biult in function.

import exo2

exo2.hello() # we import stright from another file.

from Cisco import shover as rongron #We imported shover function from Cisco folder and renamed it as rongron. We always have to create __init__.py inorder to make 
# a folder searchable fuction to be imported in the other folder like Cisco folder and __init__.py (is essential in every folder to be importable as a function)
rongron.showversion()
