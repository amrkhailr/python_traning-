#3. How Much Insurance?
#Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. 
#Write a program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.

def insurance(Amount):
    percent = 0.8
    print(percent*Amount)
